# fp_newsletter

Version 7.0.1

The TYPO3 extension fp_newsletter is designed to provide a newsletter subscription and unsubscription service for the 
table tt_address which can be used by the extension mail OR for the table fe_users which can be used by luxletter or mail. 
Furthermore, it is designed to be compatible with the GDPR. A log is written about every action in a separate table.
Old log entries can be deleted by a scheduler task.
Supports Google reCaptcha v3 or a mathematical captcha.
And there is a widget for the dashboard available.
Available languages: english, german/deutsch, french/fran√ßais and italian/italiano.
